A candidate without a ballot-listed affiliation to either the Democrat or Republican Parties will be considered a member of one of these parties based on the party that they most recently expressed their intent to caucus with at the time the 2024 House, Senate and Presidency are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources.\n\nIf control of the House is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Speaker of the US House who is selected following the 2024 US general election.\n\nIf control of the Senate is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Majority Leader of the US Senate who is selected following the 2024 US general election.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC.

Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the two parties receives by the sum of all votes cast in the election.\n\nThis market will resolve based off the official vote count once all U.S. States and the District of Columbia have certified their votes.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\n​​A candidate's party will be determined by their ballot-listed or otherwise identifiable affiliation with that party at the time all of the 2024 House elections are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources. A candidate without a ballot-listed affiliation to either the Democrat or Republican parties will be considered a member of one of these parties based on the party that they most recently expressed their intent to caucus with at the time all of the House elections are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC. This market will resolve once all three sources have conclusively called all House elections. If all three sources do not achieve consensus in calling the relevant races for this market, it will resolve based on the official certification.\n",

This market will resolve once all three sources have conclusively called all House elections.
